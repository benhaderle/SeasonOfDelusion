    text: Wait, so they got a coach for us?
  - speaker: Rico
    text: 'Yeah dude. '
  - speaker: James
    text: So when's your dad coming down?
  - speaker: Rico
    text: Shut up dude. Ms. Meadows didn't even talk to him.
  - speaker: Ryan
    text: Thank god, your dad's crazy.
  - speaker: Rico
    text: Sorry you're too weak to take the heat, Ryan.
  - speaker: James
    text: I think he's here.
  - speaker: Coach
    text: Hey, you guys are the runners, I'm guessing?
  - speaker: Rico
    text: Yeah boss.
  - speaker: Coach
    text: Well, I'm the new coach. Are we waiting on anyone?
  - speaker: James
    text: Nah, this should be everyone.
  - speaker: Coach
    text: Alrighty, then let's get to it. I'm Coach Jim.  Background on me is that
      I ran in high school, did a couple years in college, then became a PT for a
      couple years. You may have seen me around as an assistant coach for Saratoga
      the last couple years.  I'm looking forward to coaching y'all this season.
      I know it's been a tough couple years with all the coaching switches, so I
      think it's important to say that I'm here to help you guys run fast times and
      get a good team performance out of you guys come November. That's enough from
      me, why don't we go around and you guys can introduce yourself.
  - speaker: Rico
    text: I can go first. I'm Rico. I'm a junior. You can call me cap, because I'm
      the leader of these fools.
  - speaker: Ryan
    text: Who the hell made you leader dude??
  - speaker: Rico
    text: Aaron, you've been taking my orders since popping out of the womb.
  - speaker: Ryan
    text: Yeah, right dude. Whatever.
  - speaker: Rico
    text: Anyway, nice to meet you Coach. Excited for the season.
  - speaker: Ryan
    text: I'll go next. I'm Ryan, also a junior. I've never taken an order from Ari
      in my life.
  - speaker: James
    text: Hi, I'm James. I'm a sophomore. As far as leaders go, I'm currently running
      a grassroots campaign to replace Ari's dictatorship with a democratically elected
      council.
  - speaker: Clark
    text: Hey, I'm Chris. I'm a sophomore with Ben. I think that's it.
  - speaker: Ryan
    text: You forgot to mention the mountains.
  - speaker: Clark
    text: Huh? Oh yeah, I live in the mountains.
  - speaker: Coach
    text: Well nice to meet you all. To cover some logistics- Practice will be every
      day 20 min after school gets out. We'll typically do 2 workouts a week and
      do something a bit longer on the weekend. Still working on getting the meet
      schedule together, but the Early Bird Invitational is in 3 weeks. As I'm sure
      you can tell, we're gonna need some more bodies out here to stand a chance
      as a team. I know there are some sports recruiting events coming up that I
      can go to, but if you guys know anyone who might be interested, bring em on
      down and we won't hurt them too bad. I think that's it. Any questions?
  - speaker: Aaron
    text: Nope.
  - speaker: Coach
    text: Great, let's get started for the day.
